> Urban areas contribute more than 60% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, through residential, commercial, and transportation activities. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly being adopted by cities worldwide to enhance carbon sequestration, offsets emissions, and promotes sustainable land management practices, thus contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.
>
> Realistic NbS implementation plans toward carbon neutrality, such as restoring natural ecosystems and increasing urban green resources, need to be both effective in mitigating carbon emissions at the global level and suitable for the socio-economic and physical conditions at the local level. Prioritizing suitable sites and solutions can enhance the long-term viability of NbS. In our research, we have explored a systematic approach to spatially prioritizing different types of NbS implementations in multiple major EU cities.
>
> The motivation for developing this tool is to offer the necessary flexibility for NbS planning, by enabling users to interact and iterate through our spatial allocation processes. Successful adoption of NbS and realization of their functionality requires a holistic and collaborative planning approach that incorporates stakeholders across scales and disciplines. This platform aims to serve as a point of departure to facilitate the identifying suitable interventions and enhancing the awareness of NbS opportunities in urban settings.
